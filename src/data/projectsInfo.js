          SkillBridge is the final project of the winter semester 2022/
          2023 at TechLabs. The team consisted of three UX designers and
          three Web Developers and included UX's research and design work
          as well as the coding work of the WebDev members. Throughout
          the project, Miro was used for the documentation of the UX
          Design process whereas the creation of wireframes and prototypes
          was done in Figma. The Web-Application was built with the MERN
